# SimpleInventorySearch

A [ResoniteModLoader](https://github.com/resonite-modding-group/ResoniteModLoader) mod for [Resonite](https://resonite.com/) that adds a filter bar to the inventory.

Typing into the bar will only show items which match that name.
Typing with @ at the beginning will filter folders too.

## Installation
1. Install [ResoniteModLoader](https://github.com/resonite-modding-group/ResoniteModLoader).
1. Place [SimpleInventorySearch.dll](https://github.com/art0007i/SimpleInventorySearch/releases/latest/download/SimpleInventorySearch.dll) into your `rml_mods` folder. This folder should be at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Resonite\rml_mods` for a default install. You can create it if it's missing, or if you launch the game once with ResoniteModLoader installed it will create the folder for you.
1. Start the game. If you want to verify that the mod is working you can check your Resonite logs.
